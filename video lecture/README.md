###Folder structure

All code is by default in the *www* folder found in the *wamp* folder. I will refer to this as the root folder.

- Put **PHP** code with **HTML** code embedded in the root folder *www*. **DO NOT PUT PURE PHP FILES IN THE ROOT FOLDER**

- Pure **PHP** files are located in php subfolder *www/php*. A pure **PHP** file has ONLY **PHP** code, not **HTML**!

- Put **JavaScript** files in the js subfolder *www/js*

- Put **CSS** files in the css subfolder *www/css*

- Put *config.ini* in *C:/* so the path is *C:/config.ini*. **FAILURE TO DO THIS WILL MAKE THE DATABASE FAIL IN ESTABLISHING CONNECTION!**

- Ask Stefan if you have any questions!
